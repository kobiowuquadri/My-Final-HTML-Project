    <p>Hello Guys, My Name is Kobiowu Quadri A. I very happy to find myself in this program, One of my Dreams is to
        become a Full-Stack Developer, But CapacitYBay has make the journey so easy for me, by learning the command line
        of GIT in how to
        creating working directories, files, to navigate to a directory, to create a branch, to merge a branch, to fork,
        to clone, to pull
        request and many more....
        Also, In GITHUB, i learnt how to use create a repository, pulling the work on my local computer to the GITHUB
        and many more..,
        One thing that really suprise me about the GITHUB is that, it is a onilne software that you can use to host your
        website for FREE,
        without paying a dime, you see that! FREE!, I'm very excited when i know that there is something like that and
        also it is an
        environnment for Developers, in which many developers can work as a team on a project on GITHUB without living
        the thier homes.
        Futhermore, then we dive into HTML, I understand that HTML is not a programming Language but a Mark-up Language
        that we use to describe
        the structure of a Webpage, also, i learnt about text formattings, headings(h1-h6), paragraph, Lists, and many
        more.....
        I'm also looking forward to learn more, and a big Thanks to Faulty HOWARD and REX for putting thier best for
        teaching us to understand
        the concept well. <br>
        Thanks CapacityBay
    </p>
